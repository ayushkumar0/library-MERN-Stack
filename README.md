# library-MERN-Stack
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Library Management System developed as part of an internship project at Ethnus.

## Introduction
The Library Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It aims to streamline and enhance the management of books, patrons, and administrative tasks within a library setting.

## Features
✨ User Roles and Access Management: Implementing user roles (Patron, Librarian, and Admin) and managing access to different functionalities based on those roles.
📖 CRUD Operations on Books: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing books in the library system.
📋 Issuing and Renewing Books: Librarians can issue books to patrons (users) and renew the issued book status based on user requests.
📚 Book Returns, Rent, and Fine Collection: Processing book returns and collecting rents and fines from patrons.

## Technologies Used
🛠️ MongoDB: NoSQL document database for flexible and scalable data storage.
🚀 Express.js: Web application framework for building server-side applications and APIs.
⚛️ React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
🔧 Node.js: JavaScript runtime for running server-side code.
🔒 Redux Toolkit: Library for managing application state in Redux.
🔐 JWT Authentication and Password Encryption: JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization, and password encryption for enhanced security.
💅 Ant Design Library: UI library for React, providing customizable and well-designed components.
